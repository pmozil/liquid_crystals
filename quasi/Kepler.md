# Kepler
## Discovered:
- Eliptical orbits; platonic model => rotational symmetry => nature is messy
- Sphere packing => conjecture; 400y to prove (formal proof: 2017)
- Snowflakes => smallest natural unit of a liquid; like spherical packing
- Hexagons tile the plane periodically; [[periodic tilings]]; [[symmetry]]; 2,3,4 and 6-fold symmetry (no 5-fold) => almost 5-fold symmetry
- This pentagon symmetry perfectly matches up [[Penrose tiling]]
