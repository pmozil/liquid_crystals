# Penrose tiling
## Initial setup
Six pentagons can almost fit within a larger one, forming a semi-periodic tiling

Idea: break the initial pentagons into smaller ones → Some of the gaps start forming rhombus shapes, other — three "spikes" → subdivide again → You can use pentagons to fill in the gaps within some shapes → All you're left with are rhombuses, stars and "justice caps" (fractions of a star) → subdivisions do not help
## Initial set
Pentagons, rhombuses, stars, and justice caps give you almost five-fold symmetry
## Distillation
Multiple tiles can be combined into just two: a thicc rhombus and a thin rhombus, plus bumps/notches, colors ora whatever are required to assure the right (aperiodic, full) tiling. Just two.
## Moiré pattern
The [[Moire pattern]] shows it all being pretty close to 5-fold symmetry but not being symmetric. You can match a transparency and a paper print of this pattern pretty closely but not 100%. There will always be some difference
# Kites and darts + curves on them
This is one of the possible distilations
## There are infinitely many patterns
The number of individual patterns is larger than your mom, but every finitely large section can be found on any arbitrary pattern if you extend it far enough. You can't tell the difference between them by looking on a local section. There are infinitely many, but just by looking at them, you could never tell them apart.
## Non-localization
These patterns seem to require some kind of long-range coordination, as just putting shapes together will lead you to gaps nothing fits in. Edge rules (curves etc.) are not defined enough to guarantee infinite tiling. However, there are sets of rules that do allow that (e.g., vertex rules).
## Why tf is the golden ratio here?
The ratio of kites to darts approaches the golden ratio $\phi$ as the pattern grows. This is because of five-fold symmetry (the ratio of the diagonal of a pentagon to the edge is $\phi$, and kites+darts are sections of pentagons). This proves that the pattern is aperiodic — if it wasn't the number of kites/darts in a period would be finite, thus, the ratio would be rational
## Paralel lines
When a certain pattern is drawn on kites/darts rather than curves, it connects to form five sets of paralell lines. This is the most visual proof of 5-fold semi-symmetry of the shape. Not really though because every set of lines is spaced very differently. For each, there are thwo spacings (long and short) that do not follow a periodic pattern (but longs/shorts will equal $\phi$).
# Main question
Can there be an analogue for this in nature? Perhaps a crystal? Penrose didn't think so, because there were only 14 already established basic units that compose crystals ([[Brasvais Lattices]] discovered in 1848), plus [[#Non-localization]]. How can a crystal "coordinate" this? Locally while condensing atoms form icosahedrons (a lot of five-fold symmetry). Scientists hypothesized that these shapes can only include about 100 atoms, but they created a 3d version of this tiling, what we now call a [[Quasicrystal]], and simulated x-ray difraction through it, finding rings of difraction points. Just a few kilometers away, completely unaware of their work another scientist created a flaky material from aluminium and manganese, and after scattering electrons off of his material he got almost the exact same pattern. The "coordination" happens because rules for how verticies connect with each other are much stronger and define the pattern much clearer than edge rules (i.e., curves) and allow you to actually tile to $\infty$. Um… Atoms kinda are verticies.
That paper also realized Kepler's pentagonal snowflake.
