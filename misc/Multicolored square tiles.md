# Multicolored square tiles
## Structures:
You're given a set of n square tiles, each consists of 4 triangles of different colors
## Rules:
- Only similar colors can touch
- No rotation of tiles, only sliding
## Question:
If you are given a set of tiles, can you always tell if they can tile a plane?
## Wang's conjecture (false)
If you can tile a plane, you can do so periodically
## Disproval
Robert Burger found a set of 20,426 tiles that could only tile the plane non-periodically. Such sets are called aperiodic tiles
## Smaller sets
Rober Burger (later): 104
Robert Canooth: 92
[[Robinson tiles]]: 6
